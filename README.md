# Battlesnake 2017
Repository for the battlesnake competition code written in Cincom Smalltalk. This code won a **2nd place in the final round in the advanced category of Battlesnake 2017**


###The files
The two files here are a **parcel** file (.pcl) and a **source** (.pst) of the code written for the annual battlesnake code competition held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Check out [battlesnake web site](battlesnake.io) for details about the competition.
The code here is exactly as run in the competition, for a snake named Medusa. A lot of it was written in a bit of a hurry, so it may not be commented up to the usual standards.

###How to read the code:
You can read the **BattlesnakeBundle.pst** file but it's meant for a computer consumption, not really for humans. To be able to browse all the code, you will need a **VisualWorks 8.2 IDE**. A free Personal Use License can be obtained from [Cincom Smalltalk web site](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/main/developer-community/trying-cincom-smalltalk/try-cincom-smalltalk/). VisualWorks is a cross-platform application development environment that runs on all major operating systems and CPU architecture - yes, even on a Raspberry Pi.
Once installed, and the IDE is up and running, you can load the **BattlesnakeBundle.pcl** parcel file to browse through the code and see the strategies and the algorithms used in the competition.

**Happy Browsing!**
